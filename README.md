I decided to learn a bit of Swift toward the end of my winter vacation, so this is an initial version of a calculator I programmed while following along with Stanford's CS 193p iOS course in Swift (programmed in a Swift 3 environment). It tests the model in several weird edge cases, though there're likely several more potential bugs from weird scenarios.

@TODO Implement the functionality of a the few operations I put in my Main.storyboard with the intention of implementing some time in the future.

@TODO Ensure the Main.storyboard view is oriented correctly to fit in landscape mode on all iOS devices (specifically for smaller screens).

I made this calculator app for fun while learning Swift 3, and hope it is of some use (of what to do or not do) later on down the road for others or myself! : )
